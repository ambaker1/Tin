I want to simplify the "tin list" thing.
I want the main package to not have the repos listed in it.
Instead, I should have everything distributed. 
Maybe I should at least have the main repo listed.
For upgrading,
tin add -auto https://github.com/ambaker1/Tin install.tcl 2.0-
tin upgrade tin


tin add $package $repo
tin remove $package $repo


tin add $package $repo

tin fetch 
tin versions

# Tin will be lighter
# It will require a specific format for the repository. 
# If other repository sources are included in the future... 


tin set $dict



Requires:
pkgInstall.tcl file in main repository 

tin create tin 



tin set {
    
}

tin packages
tin get $name
[tin get]

tin new 

tin import 

tin versions $name $reqs ...

tin get $name 
tin get
